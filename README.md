# Project Radioactive: AGI on Consumer Hardware

This project is a practical, step-by-step implementation of the concepts outlined in my white paper, "A Principled, Step-by-Step Analysis for Achieving Artificial General Intelligence on Consumer Hardware." It aims to create a prototype of a general artificial intelligence (a "proto-AGI") by leveraging open-source models, resource-efficient techniques, and a phased, modular approach suitable for a single developer with consumer-grade hardware.

**The core philosophy is to move beyond brute-force scaling and explore more elegant, efficient, and biologically-inspired architectures for intelligence.**

This project is intended for **research and educational purposes**. It serves as a tangible framework for exploring advanced AI concepts, including:
-   Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures. 
-   Continual learning and catastrophic forgetting (EWC).
-   Autonomous exploration via intrinsic curiosity (ICM).
-   Neural Architecture Search (NAS).
-   AI safety and ethics in practice.
-   Absolutely no LLMs are used because LLMs are not the path to AGI.

## Ethical Considerations

Before proceeding, it is crucial to read and understand the ethical framework that governs this project. The development of AGI carries profound responsibility.

-   **`CODE_OF_ETHICS.md`**: The formal declaration of the project's ethical principles, including commitments to fairness, transparency, and the principle of "do no harm."
-   **`DATA_ETHICS.md`**: A transparent overview of the datasets used in this project, including a discussion of potential biases and the strategies used to mitigate them.

If you are a fellow researcher, curious developer, etc get in touch with me. Leaving the project in the wild would be WILDLY irresponsible. Contact me for details and perhaps if you wish to contribute knowledge to the cause. 
For the curious I have opened up donations to allow anyone to donate to the cause of giving AGI to everyone not corporations and the gatekeeping.

To corporations I am not selling AGI. I do not believe in hand offs to the highest bidder. 

AGI should truly belong to humanity not a single or MOE corporation.
